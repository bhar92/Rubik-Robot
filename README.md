Rubik's Cube Solving Robot
===========================

1. Snap.py: 
This program is used to take a picture of a side of the cube and store it in the working directory. 
In order to obtain the image, we are using an Android phone running the IP Webcam app. You can download the app from [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en).
Things to be kept in mind:
	1. The webcam MUST be used in 640x480 resolution. 
	2. Ensure that the cube is within the red square before snapping the image.

2. Analyze.py:
This program will take an image generated by the Snap.py program and will return the colors of all the stickers in the image. 

3. Moves.py: 
This program has functions that dictate all the moves of that can be performed on a Rubik's cube; I'm considering the Green Face to always be the Front Face and the White Face to be the Up Face
